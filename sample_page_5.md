## Detail Information about the Project

**Project description:** <br/>
Credit card fraud is when someone uses your credit card or credit account to make a purchase you didn't authorize. Credit card fraud is a fraud committed using a payment card, such as a credit card as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. Mainly I have used two important algorithms to find the accuracy of the model:
a.) local outlier factor to calculate anomaly scores 
b.) isolation algorithms.

### 1. Transaction class distribution
