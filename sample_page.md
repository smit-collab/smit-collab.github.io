**Project description:** Stock-Market-Analysis project was developed to perform data analysis on the historical data of the publicly listed companies on the data provided by yahoo finance.
Both fundamental and technical analysis was done to understand the trends in the market. Thorough data analysis is done to discover useful information.
For my case study, I chose big tech companies that are publicly listed: google, ford, apple, Microsoft.
