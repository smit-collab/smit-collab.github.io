### Project Description:
In this project, I have analyzed the Uber Pickups in New York City. The dataset is obtained from the kaggle. New York City has five boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Staten Island. I have applied K means clustering algorithm to understand the trips taken on uber in New York City.
